								<h2>Putting Citizens in Charge of the Democratic Process
								</h2>
							</header>
							<p> The Handivote system allows people to vote using their mobile phones. 
							Our proposal includes a series of checks and balances which will ensure that:
							<ul>
							<li>Voting is anonymous and no one will be able to link the vote to the voter
<li>Voters can vote from wherever they are
<li>They can vote by sending a simple SMS message
<li>They can check whether their vote was counted correctly once the referendum is over
<li>They can ensure that all votes were tallied correctly and that no fraud has occurred
							</ul>
							The proposal makes it possible to conduct frequent referenda which will ensure that 
							citizens are able to participate in the democratic process regularly and not only at elections.
							</p>
